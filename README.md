# Blackout Secure Endpoint Toolkit

[![Made by BlackoutSecure](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20by-BlackoutSecure-1f1f1f)](https://github.com/blackoutsecure)

Service-first endpoint automation with shared configuration contracts and native
platform backends. Deployment scripts do not require Node.js, Rust, a resident
toolkit agent, or a particular management platform.
The optional compiled Rust CLI shares configuration and read-only planning;
it does not replace native privilege boundaries or require a Rust runtime.

## Services

| Service | Purpose | Implemented platforms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Devbox](services/devbox/README.md) | Disk-image-backed development workspaces, mounting, and backups | [Windows](services/devbox/windows/README.md), [macOS](services/devbox/macos/README.md) |
| [GhostBSD Remote Access](services/ghostbsd-remote-access/README.md) | MATE/XRDP guest setup, SSH onboarding, VM checks, and tunneled desktop access | [GhostBSD guest](services/ghostbsd-remote-access/ghostbsd/README.md), [Windows operator](services/ghostbsd-remote-access/windows/README.md) |

Linux is a future backend, not an implemented or certified Devbox platform.
Portable policy tests run on Ubuntu; that does not imply Linux storage support.
Devbox is not the Microsoft Dev Box cloud service or a compliance scanner.

A service is an operational capability, not necessarily a background daemon.
Code, tests, and platform usage guidance live with their service. There is no
separate documentation index duplicating these READMEs. Add a platform or shared
runtime library only when it has a real implementation and tests.

## Build deployable scripts

On a development/build machine with Node.js 22.16 or later:

```text
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run build
npm test
```

The build validates [shared defaults](services/devbox/config/defaults.json)
against the [service schema](services/devbox/config/schema.json), follows local
schema references, and embeds native validators and required resources. Windows
remediation embeds the one authored worker automatically. No package installation
occurs on endpoints.

The default build also generates [GhostBSD Remote Access](services/ghostbsd-remote-access/README.md)
under `output/ghostbsd-remote-access/`. Its Windows operator embeds the guest
backend; no original setup ZIP or adjacent helper scripts are required.

Deploy the generated scripts under `output/devbox/windows/` or
`output/devbox/macos/`, not the authoring templates under `services/`.
Do not deploy a checkout or depend on adjacent repository files.

An optional partial deployment profile can set defaults for a new installation:

```text
npm run build -- --config path-to-profile.json
```

Existing persisted desired configuration takes precedence over packaged defaults.
To reconfigure an installed endpoint, explicitly supply a profile using the
platform entry point; rebuilding alone is not a policy override.

## Documentation and deployment

- [Devbox configuration and migration](services/devbox/README.md)
- [Windows detection, remediation, and scheduled worker](services/devbox/windows/README.md)
- [macOS CLI and managed PKG deployment](services/devbox/macos/README.md)
- [Framework standards and extension boundaries](framework/README.md)
- [GhostBSD guest setup and Windows remote-access operator](services/ghostbsd-remote-access/README.md)
- [Contributing and validation](CONTRIBUTING.md)

For macOS fleets, the build stages a PKG payload with a user-session initialization
LaunchAgent. Packaging supports Developer ID Installer signing, notarization, and
stapling. A `.app` is not required for automation; add a GUI only if there is a
user-facing need.

## Rust CLI

The [Rust framework](framework/README.md#rust-framework) resolves the same
authored defaults/schemas for both services and produces read-only native
adapter plans. It does not install packages, elevate, run SSH, or execute the
listed native operations. There is no Rust `apply` command.

With the pinned Rust SDK and a complete native linker toolchain:

```text
cargo run --locked -- services
cargo run --locked -- configuration --service ghostbsd-remote-access
cargo run --locked -- plan --service ghostbsd-remote-access --platform windows --operation apply --user desktop
npm run check:rust
npm run test:rust
npm run build:rust
```

`desktop` is an example explicit existing account, not a default or an account
created by the CLI. `--config` selects an explicit partial JSON profile.
There is no implicit lookup of installed or private configuration.
Release binaries are under `target/release/`; they embed public schemas,
defaults and service metadata and run without Cargo, Node.js or a checkout.
Native script generation remains independently available through `npm run build`.

## Safety

- Inspect configuration and status before applying changes.
- Preserve native privilege boundaries: Windows is elevated; macOS refuses root.
- Keep disk formats, installed paths, and backups stable across source moves.
- Validate on disposable native endpoints before production rollout.
- Do not embed credentials, inventories, tenant IDs, or internal endpoints.
- Never interpret a syntax check, mock suite, unsigned package, or skipped native
  test as evidence of a production-ready deployment.
